str = 'In 2025, technology continues to evolve rapidly. A group of 26 students, each named after a letter from A to Z, participated in a coding marathon. The event lasted 48 hours, spanning two days and one night. Along the way, they solved 15 challenging problems, each more complex than the last. Their solutions used Python, Java, and C++. By midnight, 6 teams had finished all tasks, while 20 students cheered them on. The winners received a trophy engraved with “ABC123.” This marathon proved that both numbers and letters play essential roles in problem-solving and innovation.'
